<strong>Hello, This is my first project using ReactJS</strong>
<p>To run this app on your local machine, you need to install node.js and create-react-app</p>
<p>Further, you need to copy the code from the files created in the components folder and from App.js</p>
<p>For simplicity, I have used json file for this project to get the data</p>
<strong>You can also install "@mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react" using npm to view the icons used here</strong>
<p>Finally run npm start and/or open localhost://3000 in your browser</p>

<br/><br/>
<strong>Thank You!!!</strong>
